Exercise: Student Database

Write a C program to create a student database using structures. Each student record should contain the following information:

Student ID (an integer)
Name (a string)
Age (an integer)
GPA (a float)
Your program should allow the user to perform the following operations:

Add a new student record.
Display all student records.
Search for a student record by ID.
Update a student record.
Delete a student record.
Exit the program.
Make sure to use dynamic memory allocation for storing student records. You can use an array of structures or linked lists, whichever you're more comfortable with.
