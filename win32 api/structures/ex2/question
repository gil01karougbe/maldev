Exercise: Employee Management System

1-Employee ID: A unique identifier for each employee.
2-Name: The full name of the employee.
3-Department: The department in which the employee works.
4-Salary: The salary of the employee.

Create an Employee Management System in C using structures and file handling. The program should have the following functionalities:

Add new employee details (ID, name, department, salary) and store them in a file.
Display all employee details stored in the file.
Search for an employee by ID.
Update employee details (name, department, salary) based on the ID.
Delete an employee record based on the ID.
Calculate and display statistics such as the total number of employees, the average salary, the highest salary, and the lowest salary.
Exit the program.
You may also implement error handling, input validation, and user-friendly menus to enhance the robustness and usability of your program.

This exercise will help you practice not only working with structures but also file handling operations, such as reading from and writing to files, and performing data manipulation tasks.
